    <h1>Hey</h1>
    <p>When I started this project, I wanted to be the guy that taught people how to build software through online courses.</p>
    <p>Shortly after beginning the creation of courses, I figured out I was not a person that liked to be in-front of a camera, telling you to subscribe to a channel trying to sell you over-priced courses so I could validate my engineering accomplishments.</p>
    <p>The truth is we are living in the future most engineers already knew was coming:</p>
        <p>The age where machine can build faster and better than those of us who spend countless hours studying the art of software engineering.</p>
    <p>The truth is you can just go to <a href="https://chat.openai.com">Chat GPT</a>,<a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Github Copilot</a> and learn how to build with AI.</p>
    <p>Rather than selling you a course, I'd rather have you go use the tools of the future.</p>
    <p>They are here to stay.</p>
    <p>The best way to learn to use them is to use them to build something you are passionate about.</p>
    <p>The best way to get started is to ask AI to build you a course for learning how to build web apps.</p>
    <p>When you're done doing that, feel free to schedule some time with me to chat about it at the link below.</p>
    <p>Welcome to the future of developing the internet.</p>
